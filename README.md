[00:00.16] (Well) How comforting, that people like you never change
[00:03.42] (Huh) You underlings, all stumbling to catch our gaze
[00:29.92] 
[00:07.95] Crumbling under the pressure
[00:09.73] Don't you just love obsession?
[00:11.62] Your struggle burst my pleasure
[00:13.54] (Got some distinct intentions)
[00:28.54] 
[00:15.30] Ah, I move you slowly (Slowly)
[00:20.70] Like bishops, castles, queens
[00:23.81] You'd be so lonely
[00:28.12] If there were not for me
[00:40.12] 
[00:31.43] The passion touching the pain
[00:32.99] Hanging the power we hold
[00:34.98] Over your mind, over your body
[00:37.07] And your signed away soul
[00:38.85] If you're looking to impress, entertain, not be of use
[00:42.80] Thеn prove you care as much you say you do
[01:03.80] 
[00:46.23] I want you crying for me
[00:48.24] I want you, I want you
[00:50.16] Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
[00:54.29] I want you fighting for mе
[00:56.28] And when you follow
[00:57.70] Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
[01:00.39] Cry for me
[01:04.77] Cry for me
[01:08.44] Cry for me
[01:12.60] Cry for me
[01:16.19] Cry for me
[01:21.19] 
[01:17.63] Go on, boy, weep (Yeah)
[01:18.30] Licking those tears, lick 'em off your cheek (Your cheek)
[01:20.26] It's clear as day
[01:21.39] Your masquerade of independence obsolete
[01:41.39] 
[01:25.37] Want you to plead (Hey)
[01:26.39] Feeling the fear from your front-row seat
[01:27.94] Click in your brain
[01:29.10] How entertaining those so desperate here to please are
[01:56.10] 
[01:32.51] All-consuming worship is all I want
[01:36.59] Is that much to ask, now I know it's not
[01:40.41] Don't you want to give up your lives and
[01:44.32] Love, love, love me
[01:53.82] 
[01:48.60] So baby, choose your sacrifice
[01:53.04] (Your happiness, all your thoughts, all your memories)
[01:55.95] How do I know you're really mine?
[02:01.50] (Get down on your knees)
[02:13.50] 
[02:03.92] I want you crying for me
[02:05.62] I want you, I want you
[02:07.35] Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
[02:11.52] I want you fighting for mе
[02:13.67] And when you follow
[02:15.10] Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
[02:18.19] Cry for me
[02:21.95] Cry for me
[02:25.88] Cry for me
[02:29.80] Cry for me
[02:33.65] Cry for me
